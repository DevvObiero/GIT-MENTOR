## 🌟 Why I Built This

As a developer, I kept asking myself:

> _"What should I do next to improve my GitHub and stand out?"_

Tired of looking at raw stats with no direction, I built **GitHub Mentor** to finally answer that question.

This isn’t just another GitHub widget — it gives you **real advice**, like:

- _"You're 7 pull requests away from leveling up!"_
- _"Earn 150 more stars to improve your visibility!"_
