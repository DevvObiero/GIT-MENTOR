## 🌟 Why I Built This

As a developer, I constantly wondered:  
> "What should I do next to improve my GitHub profile and stand out?"

**GitHub Mentor** was born from that frustration. It doesn’t just show stats — it tells you:
- _"You're 7 pull requests away from leveling up"_
- _"Earn 150 more stars to improve your visibility"_
